The goal of sosRus is to tame some gnarly survey data! The functions included in this package are designed to ease the burden of pulling data from the SOS API and clean it in preparation for reporting and evaluation.

## Installation

You can install the development version of sosRus from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("ztimpe/sosRus")
```

## Example

This is a basic example which shows you how to construct the API call. The first
function, table_fields, provides a list of character vectors aligning with the
fields drawn from the APIs as of August, 2022. 
```{r}
library(sosRus)
# Use the table_fields function to load a list of character vectors for pulling 
# from the API. Check for accuracy!!
table_fields <- table_fields()
head(table_fields)[1]
```
When viewing this list, it will become apparent that the character vectors are 
simply the field names, and are not ready to be plugged into the API call. To 
prepare these vectors for the API call, use the bracketize function. This function
takes a character vector or list of character vectors and places brackets at the 
beginning and end, as well as forward slashes and commas. The output of this 
function should mirror the field name expression in the API call.
```{r example}
# Use bracketize to add brackets, slashes, and quotations for the API call
bracketize(table_fields()[1])
```
Once the table fields have been bracketized, it is time to place them in the API
call, using the apify function. This function already has the base URL set as the 
default, but you will need to specify the table name you will pull from, the 
fields (after being bracketized), the key, and page. To this point, nothing should
be different from the classical API calls that are used for pulling SOS data.
```{r apify}
# Use apify to create an API call address. 
apify("fields","table_name","key","base_url")
```
